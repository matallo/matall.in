<h2>Hardware</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ikea Markus</strong><br />High-end desk chair from Ikea.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>MacBook Pro</strong><br />(Retina, 13-inch, Mid 2014), work computer. This is where most of the software development gets done. I usually have it attached to an external Dell display at the <a href="https://cartodb.com/">CartoDB</a> office.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>MacBook Air</strong><br />(11-inch, Late 2010), home computer. I bought it with my first payroll. <strong>Best computer I ever had.</strong></p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Dell S2309W</strong><br />When it comes to displays I always trust Dell. This was the lower-end screen I could afford at the time and has accompanied me since then.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Logitech Anywhere MX</strong><br />I'm used to touchpad gestures, but I easily jump to the mouse for some tasks. This is the only wireless mouse I've come to like, after a couple of years. I just can't Magic Mouse. — <a href="http://amzn.to/1kUMsEu">Amazon</a></p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Audio-Technica ATH-M50</strong><br />Red goes faster. After some research these were some of the best over-ear headphones, and they are worth every dollar. — <a href="http://amzn.to/1WYndND">Amazon</a></p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Moto E</strong><br />(2nd Gen.), I've learnt to know I don't really need the latest iPhone. Despite I really miss a better camera (it doesn't even have Flash), the rest is good enough so I would't mind breaking or losing it. — <a href="http://amzn.to/1kUSC7A">Amazon</a></p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Garmin Fenix</strong><br />I'm not riding the smartwatch wave yet, but I like to track my runs and rides. It provides the classic <abbre title="Altimeter, Barometer, Compass">ABC</abbre>, plus GPS. One day I'll wear a Speedmaster Professional Moonwatch.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>After using one during my last holiday trip, I'm planning to buy a <a href="http://amzn.to/1kwatlz">Kindle Paperwhite</a>.</p>

<h2>Software</h2>

<p>Beware, entering the Nerd zone.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Sketch</strong><br />Haven't paid for a personal license yet. I'm still broken-hearted after supporting version 2, but we fully use it at <a href="https://cartodb.com/">CartoDB</a> for design.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Sublime Text</strong><br />Coming from the now Open Source software TextMate, Sublime Text is the fastest and simplest code editor I've used. From time to time I give Atom a try but I still don't feel comfortable. I use it with <a href="http://kkga.github.io/spacegray/">Spacegray</a> theme, and <a href="https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro">Source Code Pro</a> font. The only vim command I know is <em>save and exit</em>.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>iTerm 2</strong><br />Along with ohmyzsh. Chruby for Ruby (and Rubygems) version management. I use Grunt for my Front-end tooling workflow, and Jekyll for building static sites (like this). Virtual Machines live in vagrant.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Google Chrome</strong><br />The usual stuff here, I spend half of the day in DevTools. I try to keep it low on extensions: <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/blipshot-%E2%80%94-one-click-scre/mdaboflcmhejfihjcbmdiebgfchigjcf">Blipshot</a> for screenshots (Awesome screenshot was better but I don't like their malicious practices), <a href="https://earthview.withgoogle.com/">Earth View</a> for new tabs (my favourite extension ever), <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-cast/boadgeojelhgndaghljhdicfkmllpafd?hl=es">Google Cast</a> as a companion for the Android Chromecast app, <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/instapaper/ldjkgaaoikpmhmkelcgkgacicjfbofhh">Instapaper</a> for saving web pages to read later, <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonview/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc">JSONView</a> (there are savages out there who read plain JSON responses), <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lastpass-free-password-ma/hdokiejnpimakedhajhdlcegeplioahd?hl=es">LastPass</a> for password management, <a href="http://quote.plus/">Quote.Plus</a> to tweet quotes with one click, and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=es">uBlock</a> to prevent tracking.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Other software and services</strong><br />There's a bunch of free and subscription-based software I use on a daily basis: ImageOptim, Spectacle, GitHub, Gmail, Slack, Wunderlist, Simplenote, Digg Reader, Pinboard, Strava, Spotify, Netflix, Plex, et cetera.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
