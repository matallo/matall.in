<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ikea Markus</strong><br />High-end desk chair from Ikea.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>MacBook Pro</strong><br />(Retina, 13-inch, Mid 2014), work computer. This is where most of the software development gets done. I usually have it attached to an external Dell display at the <a href="https://carto.com/">CARTO</a> office.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>MacBook Air</strong><br />(11-inch, Late 2010), home computer. I bought it with my first payroll. <strong>Best computer I ever had.</strong></p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Dell S2309W</strong><br />When it comes to displays I always trust Dell. This was the lower-end screen I could afford at the time and has accompanied me since then.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Logitech Anywhere MX</strong><br />I'm used to touchpad gestures, but I'll easily jump to the mouse for some tasks. This is the only wireless mouse I've come to like, after a couple of years. — <a href="http://amzn.to/1kUMsEu">Amazon</a></p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Audio-Technica ATH-M50</strong><br />Red goes faster. After some research these were some of the best over-ear headphones, and they are worth every dollar. — <a href="http://amzn.to/1WYndND">Amazon</a></p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Samsung Galaxy S4</strong><br />I've learnt to know I don't really need the latest iPhone.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Garmin Fenix</strong><br />Classic <abbr title="Altimeter, Barometer, Compass">ABC</abbr>, plus GPS. One day I'll wear a Speedmaster Professional Moonwatch. — <a href="http://amzn.to/1KP0DXX">Amazon</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><strong>TomTom Multi-Sport</strong><br />A multi-sports watch I bought after I crashed my Garmin Fenix, and used extensively meanwhile I had it fixed. I miss advanced interval training setup, but it's good value for money. For the longer runs I rely on the Garmin Fenix. — <a href="http://amzn.to/21kZDlN">Amazon</a></p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Kindle Paperwhite</strong><br />I bought it right after using one during my last holiday trip. — <a href="http://amzn.to/1kwatlz">Amazon</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 class="Title Title--cTypo1 Title--h2 Content-title Content-title--h2">Software</h2>

<p>Beware, entering the Nerd zone.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Sketch</strong><br />Haven't paid for a personal license yet. I'm broken-hearted with their pricing, but we fully use it at <a href="https://carto.com/">CARTO</a> for design.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Sublime Text</strong><br />Coming from the now Open Source software TextMate, Sublime Text is the fastest and simplest code editor I've ever used. From time to time I give Atom a try but I still don't feel comfortable. I use it with <a href="http://kkga.github.io/spacegray/">Spacegray</a> theme, and <a href="https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro">Source Code Pro</a> font. The only vim command I know is <code>:wq</code>.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>iTerm 2</strong><br />Along with ohmyzsh. <a href="https://github.com/postmodern/chruby/">Chruby</a> for Ruby (and Rubygems), and <a href="https://github.com/creationix/nvm">NVM</a> for Node version management. I use <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> and <a href="http://bower.io/">Bower</a> for my Front-end tooling workflow, and <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> for building static sites (like this). I use vagrant to run Virtual Machines.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Google Chrome</strong><br />The usual stuff here, I spend half of the day in DevTools. I try to keep it low on extensions: <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/blipshot-%E2%80%94-one-click-scre/mdaboflcmhejfihjcbmdiebgfchigjcf">Blipshot</a> for screenshots (Awesome screenshot was better but I don't like some of their practices), <a href="https://earthview.withgoogle.com/">Earth View</a> for new tabs (my favourite extension ever), <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-cast/boadgeojelhgndaghljhdicfkmllpafd?hl=es">Google Cast</a> as a companion for the Android Chromecast app, <a href="https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/JSONView-for-Chrome">JSONView</a> (I can't read plain JSON responses), and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=es">uBlock</a> to prevent tracking. I use bookmarklets in the bookmarks bar to send webpages to Pinboard and Instapaper.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Other software and services</strong><br />There's a bunch of free and subscription-based software I use on a daily basis: 1Password, Spectacle, f.lux, ImageOptim, GitHub, Gmail, Slack, Wunderlist, Simplenote, Pinboard, Feedly, Instapaper, Strava, Spotify, Netflix, et cetera.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
