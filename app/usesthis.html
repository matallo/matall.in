<h2>Hardware</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ikea Markus</strong><br />High-end desk chair from Ikea.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>MacBook Pro</strong><br />(Retina, 13-inch, Mid 2014), work computer. This is where most of the software development gets done. I usually have it attached to an external Dell display at the <a href="https://cartodb.com/">CartoDB</a> office.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>MacBook Air</strong><br />(11-inch, Late 2010), home computer. I bought it with my first payroll. <strong>Best computer I ever had.</strong></p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Dell S2309W</strong><br />When it comes to displays I always trust Dell. This was the lower-end screen I could afford at the time and has accompanied me since then.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Logitech Anywhere MX</strong><br />I'm used to touchpad gestures, but I easily jump to the mouse for some tasks. This is the only wireless mouse I've come to like, after a couple of years. I just can't Magic Mouse. — <a href="http://amzn.to/1kUMsEu">Amazon</a></p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Audio-Technica ATH-M50</strong><br />Red goes faster. After some research these were some of the best over-ear headphones, and they are worth every dollar. — <a href="http://amzn.to/1WYndND">Amazon</a></p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Samsung Galaxy S4</strong><br />I've learnt to know I don't really need the latest iPhone.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Garmin Fenix</strong><br />Classic <abbre title="Altimeter, Barometer, Compass">ABC</abbre>, plus GPS. One day I'll wear a Speedmaster Professional Moonwatch. — <a href="http://amzn.to/1KP0DXX">Amazon</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><strong>TomTom Multi-Sport</strong><br />I crashed my Garmin Fenix, so meanwhile I have it fixed I bought the cheapest watch for multisports training. I miss advanced interval training setup, but it's good value for money. — <a href="http://amzn.to/21kZDlN">Amazon</a></p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Kindle Paperwhite</strong><br />I bought it right after using one during my last holiday trip. — <a href="http://amzn.to/1kwatlz">Amazon</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Software</h2>

<p>Beware, entering the Nerd zone.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Sketch</strong><br />Haven't paid for a personal license yet. I'm still broken-hearted after supporting version 2, but we fully use it at <a href="https://cartodb.com/">CartoDB</a> for design.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Sublime Text</strong><br />Coming from the now Open Source software TextMate, Sublime Text is the fastest and simplest code editor I've used. From time to time I give Atom a try but I still don't feel comfortable. I use it with <a href="http://kkga.github.io/spacegray/">Spacegray</a> theme, and <a href="https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro">Source Code Pro</a> font. The only vim command I know is <code>:wq</code>.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>iTerm 2</strong><br />Along with ohmyzsh. <a href="https://github.com/postmodern/chruby/">Chruby</a> for Ruby (and Rubygems) version management. I use <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> and <a href="http://bower.io/">Bower</a> for my Front-end tooling workflow, and <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> for building static sites (like this). Virtual Machines live in vagrant.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Google Chrome</strong><br />The usual stuff here, I spend half of the day in DevTools. I try to keep it low on extensions: <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/blipshot-%E2%80%94-one-click-scre/mdaboflcmhejfihjcbmdiebgfchigjcf">Blipshot</a> for screenshots (Awesome screenshot was better but I don't like some of their practices), <a href="https://earthview.withgoogle.com/">Earth View</a> for new tabs (my favourite extension ever), <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-cast/boadgeojelhgndaghljhdicfkmllpafd?hl=es">Google Cast</a> as a companion for the Android Chromecast app, <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonview/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc">JSONView</a> (there are savages out there who read plain JSON responses), <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lastpass-free-password-ma/hdokiejnpimakedhajhdlcegeplioahd?hl=es">LastPass</a> for password management, and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=es">uBlock</a> to prevent tracking. I use bookmarklets in the bookmarks bar to send webpages to Pinboard and Instapaper.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Other software and services</strong><br />There's a bunch of free and subscription-based software I use on a daily basis: ImageOptim, Spectacle, GitHub, Gmail, Slack, Wunderlist, Simplenote, Pinboard, Digg Reader, Instapaper, Strava, Spotify, Netflix, Plex, et cetera.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Gear</h2>

<p>As I started training for triathlon in late 2015, I thought it could be interesting to add a section with the gear that I use.</p>

<h3>Swimming</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Arena swimsuit, goggles, and swim cap</strong><br />Basic equipment for swimming pool. I'm not doing any openwater yet, so no wetsuit.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Bike</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Scott Sportster X40</strong><br />Urban bike to ride in the city, and the occasional trail in Casa de Campo. I want to buy a road bike for the next season and I'm already considering a Scott Speedster 20 or a Canyon Endurace AL 6.0.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Gore Bike Wear Element Bib Tights</strong><br />Very confortable and warm on cooler days. I have some other spare tights but you can tell the difference in terms of the quality of the fabric. — <a href="http://amzn.to/21TbdBo">Amazon</a></p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Gore Bike Wear Element Windstopper Soft Shell Jacket</strong><br />I love this soft shell jacket. It fits perfectly and protects from wind, and light rain. — <a href="http://amzn.to/1psWsaw">Amazon</a></p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Endura Xtract long sleeve</strong><br />I usually wear this under the jacket in cold weather, or when temperatures are low in the morning. — <a href="http://www.chainreactioncycles.com/es/es/maillot-de-manga-larga-endura-xtract-ss16/rp-prod91321">Chain Reaction Cycles</a></p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Cold weather gloves</strong><br />5€ pair of gloves from Decathlon.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Running</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Running t-shirt</strong><br />Both long and short sleeve t-shirts from races, depending on the temperature, and time of the year.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Kalenji running tights</strong><br />I just have one pair but they wash and dry very quickly. I have had them for years.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Kalenji trail running shoes</strong><br />My first running shoes, since I started running continuously. I think I will replace them soon.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<!-- h3>Mountaineering</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Bestard Advance K Pro</strong><br />My first semi-rigid boots, and highly recommended. — <a href="http://www.barrabes.com/bestard-advance-k-pro/p-30922">Barrabes</a></p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Columbia Full Zip Fleece</strong><br />Second layer of choice. — <a href="http://www.barrabes.com/columbia-fast-trek-ii-full-zip/p-42966">Barrabes</a></p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>The North Face Summit Series jacket</strong><br />I use it almost every day, and in the mountains. It's quite waterproof, but if it starts raining/snowing I prefer a Columbia jacket that I wear when I go skiing, too.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>The North Face Jester / Terra 65</strong><br />I like to carry a small backbpack for short trips. For longer excursions I use a big 65L backpack. — <a href="http://www.barrabes.com/the-north-face-terra-65/p-41978">Barrabes</a></p>
  </li>
</ul -->

<p>I've bought the previous products online from <strong>Amazon, Wiggle, Chain Reaction Cycles, and Decathlon</strong>, and I'm very happy so far with the products and the shipping.</p>
