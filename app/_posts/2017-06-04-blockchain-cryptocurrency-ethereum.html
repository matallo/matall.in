<p>Several weeks ago I returned from my vacation in California, and despite I really wanted to publish the notes and pictures I took during those days in the West coast as soon as I came back, I scarcely had time besides work, and training. On top of that a new current obsession has taken over: <strong>Blockchain and cryptocurrency</strong>.</p>

<h2 class="Title Title--cTypo1 Title--h2 Content-title Content-title--h2">Blockchain</h2>

<p>I first heard of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain">Blockchain</a> several years ago, and mostly referring to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a>. Since then I've been following casually its development, and watching from the sidelines. <a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" class="Footnote js-Footnote">1</a> I wasn't really interested in its use as digital currency, but I was hooked on the underlying technology, and its decentralized design and applications.</p>

<p>If I already lost you, before going any further I'd highly recommend watching this TED talk about <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/don_tapscott_how_the_blockchain_is_changing_money_and_business">How the Blockchain is changing money and business</a>.</p>

<p>Ok, we're back.</p>

<p>If there was a moment I could take a glimpse into the future, and envision what role Blockchains played in it, it was after watching this talk by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVyv4t0OKe4">Mike Hearn: Autonomous agents, self driving cars and Bitcoin</a>. I was already convinced Blockchain was part of that future, but I didn't think we were close yet.</p>

<p><strong>Several years have passed, and Bitcoin still has to face its most notorious challenges:</strong> scalability of the platform, whose complexity grows exponentially as Bitcoin does, with bigger and bigger transaction times and fees; and agreement between all parts of the community. There are <a href="https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/01/26/segwit-benefits/">highly technical problems</a> to solve, too.</p>

<p>Many visible heads have spoken on the current situation of Bitcoin, such <a href="https://blog.plan99.net/the-resolution-of-the-bitcoin-experiment-dabb30201f7">Mike Hearn</a> himself, and it doesn't look as bright as once seemed.</p>

<h2 class="Title Title--cTypo1 Title--h2 Content-title Content-title--h2">Ethereum</h2>

<p>Recently, this growing interest has picked up with a new decentralized platform. <a href="https://www.ethereum.org/">Ethereum</a> is a distributed computing platform that can execute scripts, or <strong>Smart contracts</strong>. <a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" class="Footnote js-Footnote">2</a></p>

<p>This new kid on the Blockchain looks more promising because of its capabilities not only as digital currency. While Ethereum popularity is peaking, so is <abbr title="Ether">ETH</abbr>, the currency Token linked to the Ethereum Blockchain, and media outlets like Bloomberg ask if <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-31/bitcoin-risks-being-eclipsed-by-digital-coin-cousin-ethereum">Bitcoin Is at Risk of No Longer Being the Biggest Digital Currency</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/">community</a> is thriving, the <a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2017/05/24/roundup-round-iii/">roadmap</a> has plenty of developments in the pipeline, and every week there are new events and announcements lined up.</p>

<p>These past weeks have been specially remarkable, and we are in a key moment now:</p>

<ul>
  <li>China's Biggest Exchanges to Add ETH</li>
  <li><a href="https://rolandkofler.github.io/flipper/">ETH over 50% of BTC Marketcap</a></li>
  <li>New members joining Enterprise Ethereum Alliance</li>
</ul>

<p>So I finally decided to take the plunge, and made some small investment.</p>

<h2 class="Title Title--cTypo1 Title--h2 Content-title Content-title--h2">Investing in cryptocurrency</h2>

<p>The first thing to know once you've finally wrapped your head around to throw some money at cryptocurrency is where to get it. There are <strong>Exchanges</strong> where you can change <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money">fiat money</a> (i.e. Euros) for cryptocurrency. My go to option when recommending an Exchange is <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/join/55bfd4532dcf7f6e680001d2">Coinbase</a> (affiliate link), but there are many others.</p>

<p>The process is very similar in all of them: you create an account, you get verified (in order to prevent money laundering), and you can use your credit card, or make a transfer for cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>Don't take this as Trading Advice, but just use common sense, as in other investments:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Don't invest more than you are willing to lose</li>
  <li>Don't try to time the market, you'll only manage to buy high, sell low</li>
  <li>Do your research, holding is the best strategy if you believe in the technology</li>
  <li>You'd probably want to take out your <abbr title="Ether">ETH</abbr> from the Exchange, and save it in some <a href="https://www.myetherwallet.com">paper wallet</a>, or buy a <a href="https://www.ledgerwallet.com/products/ledger-nano-s">hardware wallet</a></li>
  <li>Take into account your capital gain/loss taxes</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you are in the possesion of some amount of cryptocurrency you will be able to send it between Exchanges, or use tools like <a href="https://shapeshift.io/#/coins">ShapeShift</a> to trade any Blockchain asset.</p>

<h3 class="Title Title--h3 Content-title Content-title--h3 Title--cTypo3">The FOMO is real</h3>

<p>Investing in cryptocurrency has been my first approach to any kind of inversion, and <strong><abbr title="Fear Of Missing Out">FOMO</abbr> is even worse than social media as you are emotionally, and financially invested.</strong></p>

<p>Now I have adopted a more relaxed attitude, but at the beginning I couldn't help but constantly check the graphs. I also found myself reading all the time to learn the technology, and keeping up with the news in order to make informed decissions.</p>

<p>You'll get familiar with terms like: <em>bull, bear, head & shoulders, margin, long, short, dip, correction</em>, and of course <em>#tothemoon</em>.</p>

<p>If at this point you still have any doubt I'd recommend reading the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/wiki/faq">FAQ in ETHtrader</a>, or the <a href="https://www.ethadvisor.com">Beginners Guide to Ether Investing</a>.</p>

<h3 class="Title Title--h3 Content-title Content-title--h3 Title--cTypo3">Tokens, and ICOs</h3>

<p>Bitcoin, and Ethereum have inspired the creation of new Tokens, that can be used to incentivize participants in the network. Some people already call <a href="https://medium.com/@cdixon/crypto-tokens-a-breakthrough-in-open-network-design-e600975be2ef">Crypto Tokens: A Breakthrough in Open Network Design</a>.</p>

<p>Also, <a href="https://medium.com/@balajis/thoughts-on-tokens-436109aabcbe">Tokens enable an alternative to traditional financing</a>, where through a token sale, or <abbr title="Initial Coin Offering)">ICO</abbr>, anyone can participate in the funding of a product, or a company. This has a huge impact in the technology of the future.</p>

<p>Some examples of these new Tokens, issued on top of the Ethereum network are <a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/">BAT</a>, from the creator of JavaScript and the co-founder of Mozilla, or <a href="https://kin.kik.com/">Kin</a>, a cryptocurrency from <a href="http://www.kik.com/">Kik</a> designed to bring people together in a new shared economy.</p>

<p>It's difficult not to think this is some kind of Ponzi scheme or just a fad, but what would you do if you could time-travel to the past and invest in the Internet after seeing its true potential? It's easier in hindsight.</p>
