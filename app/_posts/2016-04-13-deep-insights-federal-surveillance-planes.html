<p>One week ago <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/peteraldhous/spies-in-the-skies">BuzzFeed News</a> broke the story of U.S. government surveillance planes routinely circling over most major cities. It was while reading the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11465978">Hacker News thread</a> on the topic that I found the data, along with notes on the analysis, available on <a href="http://buzzfeednews.github.io/2016-04-federal-surveillance-planes/analysis.html">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>As I showed on my <a href="/posts/deep-insights-visualizing-1m-flight-routes/">flights routes post</a> we are working at <a href="https://cartodb.com/">CartoDB</a> on a visualization solution to explore and analyze location data.</p>

<p>This time I didn't have to collect the data as <strong>BuzzFeed News</strong> had already done the job. I just recreated their analysis with a set of widgets for dynamic filtering.</p>

<h2>Extra ball: @putohelicoptero</h2>

<p>Checking the methodology used by <strong>BuzzFeed News</strong> I asked myself:</p>

<blockquote class="Blockquote">What if we could do the same analysis with Spanish cities?</blockquote>

<p>Actually, this is something many Madrid citizens have already brought up before: If you live near Madrid city center, you'd have noticed the annoying noise of a helicopter flying over the city on some quiet nights. Just to give a rough idea, there's a Twitter account called <a href="https://twitter.com/putohelicoptero">@putohelicoptero</a> featuring the helicopter.</p>

<p>Digging for information I found the model of the helicopter in a news article by <a href="http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2012/10/26/madrid/1351281127.html">El Mundo</a>, reporting all the inconveniences that the now known <strong>EC-135 'Cóndor'</strong> caused.</p>

<p>As explained in the <strong>BuzzFeed News</strong> analysis, <a href="https://www.flightradar24.com/">Flightradar24</a> receives data from a network of ground-based receivers, <a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" class="Footnote js-Footnote">1</a> you just need an identifier for each aircraft to access that data. If only there was an aircraft registry similar to the Federal Aviation Administration <a href="http://www.faa.gov/licenses_certificates/aircraft_certification/aircraft_registry/releasable_aircraft_download/">registration database</a> I could identify the model the "Policia Nacional" flights.</p>

<p>And it exists.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.seguridadaerea.gob.es/lang_castellano/aeronaves/matric_clasif_regis/default.aspx">Registro de Matrícula de Aeronaves Civiles</a> publishes a <a href="http://www.seguridadaerea.gob.es/media/3748914/aeronaves_inscritas.pdf">document</a> with all the aircraft registered in Spain. <a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" class="Footnote js-Footnote">2</a> At first glance, at least 41 of those aircraft were a match with the model I was looking for, and then a colleague helped me introducing them in <strong>Flightradar24</strong> for further filtering. <a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" class="Footnote js-Footnote">3</a></p>

<p>Once we found it, we just had to export the location data and map it in <a href="https://cartodb.com/">CartoDB</a>. As an example, this is the flight of the helicopter for New Year's Eve, checking Santiago Bernabéu stadium (Start of San Silvestre Vallecana), Vallecas (End of San Silvestre Vallecana), and Plaza de Sol.</p>

<p>At a lower scale, "Policia Nacional" is also conducting surveillance flights that can be tracked, and later analyzed. At last we can already answer the question:</p>

<blockquote class="Blockquote">What is the @putohelicoptero looking for?</blockquote>

<p>We can see in which zones were conducted most of the surveillance flights, performing a spatial join to the boundaries of <a href="http://datos.madrid.es/portal/site/egob/menuitem.c05c1f754a33a9fbe4b2e4b284f1a5a0/?vgnextoid=46b55cde99be2410VgnVCM1000000b205a0aRCRD&vgnextchannel=374512b9ace9f310VgnVCM100000171f5a0aRCRD
">Madrid barrios</a> (activate the layer in the map above). <a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" class="Footnote js-Footnote">4</a></p>

<p><em>Disclaimer: <a href="https://www.flightradar24.com/">Flightradar24</a> has a pretty restrictive license, thus I haven't shared the data from <strong>@putohelicoptero</strong>. The data for federal surveillance flights is already available in BuzzFeed News GitHub account.</em></p>
