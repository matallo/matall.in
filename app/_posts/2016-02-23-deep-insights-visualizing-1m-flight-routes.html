<p>Last week a friend <a href="https://twitter.com/txarly/status/699349558497845248">asked on Twitter</a> how to extract some data from <a href="http://www.flightstats.com/company/monthly-performance-reports/airlines/">Airline On-Time Performance Reports</a> in a Tableau public dashboard. I replied back with some tricks using Tabula, when the raw data or a workbook aren't provided, and turned in.</p>

<p>While the data was interesting, it lacked location reference, thus eliminating the possibility of representing it on a map, not to mention further geospatial analysis. But the idea of visualizing it lived on.</p>

<p>Friday night, destroyed after a hard week. I got home, had some dinner, and started poking at FlightStats Developer Center. I grabbed a RedBull to stay awake, and wrote a script to get the rating for every route in a dataset from <a href="http://openflights.org/data.html">OpenFlights.org</a>.</p>

<p>I validated the visualization with a sample of flights departing from <a href="https://matallo.carto.com/builder/dbc10032-d7f3-11e5-8e48-0e31c9be1b51/embed">Barcelona</a>, with a very simple line visualization: a color ramp corresponding to a 5 star scale (red for 1, green for 5).</p>

<p>Several hours, a couple of <code>"Authorization failed. usage limits are exceeded"</code>, and different API keys later I had the data.</p>

<p>Fast forward to this week. We've been working on some <em>new and shiny</em> stuff at CartoDB that <a href="https://carto.com/blog/deep-insights/">has just been presented</a> at <abbr title="Mobile World Congress">MWC</abbr> â€” <a href="https://carto.com/engine/">CartoDB for Deep Insights</a>. I had the data ready, so I uploaded it to CartoDB, and created my first Deep Insights dashboard within a couple of minutes. BOOM.</p>

<p>A quick look at the visualization and I can start uncovering stories.</p>

<p>We're continuously working to improve this, so any feedback is welcomed. Go ahead and <a href="https://team.carto.com/u/matallo/tables/ratings_copy_1/public">play with the data</a>.</p>

<p>You can check the code in <a href="https://github.com/matallo/flightstats">GitHub</a>.</p>

I really, really, really got inspired by <a href="https://defaultnamehere.tumblr.com/post/139351766005/graphing-when-your-facebook-friends-are-awake">this post</a> to share the visualization. I usually tinker a lot but never end up sharing anything because I'm too critical with the results, so please be kind.</em></p>
