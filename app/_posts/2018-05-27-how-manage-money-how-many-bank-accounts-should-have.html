<p>It's been three months since we relocated to London (yes, I changed jobs and changed cities, I'll write more about this) and one of the things I've had to give some proper thought was how to manage my money in a similar way to the one I had back in Madrid, with the peculiarities of the UK banking system.</p>

<p>One can spend hours and hours creating spreadsheets, or reading <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/">personal finance forums</a>, and still <strong>one of the best proven strategies that you'll find to budget your money is having multiple bank accounts</strong> (also called multiple jam-jars, envelopes or piggy banks). The underlying idea is to have multiple bank accounts with clearly differentiated purposes and allocate some percentage of your income to every category so you don't have to think if you can afford any purchase.</p>

<p>Find below a diagram with a representation of the <strong>eight different current accounts and savings accounts</strong> that I have, <a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" class="Footnote js-Footnote">1</a> and how they all are connected. They fall into three main categories which are <strong>Savings, Spending, and Investment</strong>. From these bank accounts, there are two joint accounts that my girlfriend can access, too.</p>

<p>Having this system of bank accounts let us pay for our day to day expenses, travel abroad, relocate to other country, all these while saving for the future.</p>

<p>I originally included more details about the amounts transfered between the accounts and how much I allocate each, but this is something that everyone should think about and decide depending on their situation. In any case it should be an automated process, that <a href="https://i.imgur.com/BfHzwr9.png">this flowchart</a> will help you break down.</p>

<p><strong>Managing bank accounts must be hassle free and maintenance costs must be as cheap as possible</strong>, even free. Here I'll describe with which banks I'm operating, many will let you create several accounts at no extra cost, and some others come with rewards programs. Do your own research and choose those that better accomodate your needs.</p>

<p>Let's dive into it.</p>

<div class="Sep Sep--content"></div>

<h2 id="main-current-account" class="Title Title--cTypo1 Title--h2 Content-title Content-title--h2">1. Main current account</h2>
<h3 class="Title Title--h3 Content-title Content-title--h3 Title--cTypo3">Salary and other income</h3>

<p>Current account: <a href="https://www.nationwide.co.uk/products/current-accounts/flexdirect/features-and-benefits">Nationwide FlexDirect</a></p>

<p>This is where your salary and any other income is paid to be distributed to the other accounts as soon as they are received. Automate this with recurring standing orders on the first day of each month. No other payments or Direct Debits should come out of this account. This is an easy way to know the balance with the total income and total expenses each month.</p>

<p>The amount received should be after tax via <a href="https://www.gov.uk/paye-for-employers">PAYE</a>, i.e. a system to collect Income Tax and National Insurance from employment.</p>

<h2 id="main-joint-current-account" class="Title Title--cTypo1 Title--h2 Content-title Content-title--h2">2. Main joint current account</h2>
<h3 class="Title Title--h3 Content-title Content-title--h3 Title--cTypo3">Rent, utilities, taxes, food</h3>

<p>Joint account: <a href="https://www.tescobank.com/current-accounts/">Tesco Bank Current Account</a></p>

<p>Probably the most important of all the accounts and where all the fixed monthly bills will be paid from. Rent, electricity bill, water bill, Internet bill, council tax, groceries, etc. Calculate the yearly expenses for the couple and divide per month, then split the quantity in two. Paying this account should be the main priority and the other accounts should be adjusted accordingly.</p>

<h2 id="current-account-personal-spending" class="Title Title--cTypo1 Title--h2 Content-title Content-title--h2">3. Current account</h2>
<h3 class="Title Title--h3 Content-title Content-title--h3 Title--cTypo3">Personal spending</h3>

<p>Current account: <a href="https://monzo.com/">Monzo</a></p>

<p>Stuff like transport, take-away food, clothes, entertainment, the occasional beer in the pub, and any other discretionary expense.</p>

<p><strong>Monzo</strong> claims to be "The bank of the future." in their website for a reason. They provide <a href="https://monzo.com/blog/2018/05/17/apple-pay-is-here/">Apple Pay</a> among other features which makes it very convenient for day-to-day spending. They work to continuosly <a href="https://monzo.com/blog/2018/05/22/making-monzo-better/">making Monzo better</a>, and have a <a href="https://trello.com/b/9tcaMB4w/monzo-transparent-product-roadmap">transparent product roadmap</a>. Also it is one of the best designed banks.</p>

<h2 id="current-account-subscription-payments" class="Title Title--cTypo1 Title--h2 Content-title Content-title--h2">4. Current account</h2>
<h3 class="Title Title--h3 Content-title Content-title--h3 Title--cTypo3">Subscription payments</h3>

<p>Current account: <a href="https://n26.com/en-eu/bank-account">N26 Bank Account</a></p>

<p>Netflix, Spotify, Strava, 1Password, pinboard.in, Internet hosting, and all the creators I enjoy supporting. <a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" class="Footnote js-Footnote">2</a> All these services and subscriptions <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/06/subscription-hell">can quickly add up</a>, and collect them in the same current account let me have some control of my digital spending.</p>

<p>Payments in any currency are free with <strong>N26</strong>, and subscriptions in foreign currencies are automatically converted at the Mastercard exchange rate.</p>

<p>I'm using the same account with the same debit card that I used in Spain, thus I didn't have to change my payment details in any subscription.</p>

<h2 id="savings-account" class="Title Title--cTypo1 Title--h2 Content-title Content-title--h2">5. Savings account</h2>
<h3 class="Title Title--h3 Content-title Content-title--h3 Title--cTypo3">Emergency fund, dream fund</h3>

<p>Savings account: <a href="https://www.nationwide.co.uk/products/savings/flex-regular-online-saver/features-and-benefits">Nationwide Flex Regular Online Saver</a></p>

<p>This is the first fund you should start building when your other needs are met. Start with one month salary and save until you have an emergency fund you are comfortable with.</p>

<p>You can have as many savings accounts as different goals. After you have built your emergency fund you can open new savings accounts for other short-term and long-terms goals, such as buying every new iPhone Apple launches, or a new bike.</p>

<p>Take into account your <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/personal-savings-allowance-factsheet/personal-savings-allowance">Personal Savings Allowance</a> for savings income tax-free.</p>

<p>I keep an emergency fund in an <a href="https://www.ing.es/cuenta-naranja/">ING Cuenta NARANJA</a> that I already had in Spain, and didn't convert to <abbr title="Pound Sterling">GBP</abbr>.</p>

<h2 id="joint-savings-account-holiday" class="Title Title--cTypo1 Title--h2 Content-title Content-title--h2">6. Joint savings account</h2>
<h3 class="Title Title--h3 Content-title Content-title--h3 Title--cTypo3">Holidays fund, house fund</h3>

<p>Savings account: <a href="https://www.tescobank.com/savings/flexible/internet-saver/index.html">Tesco Bank Internet Saver Account</a></p>

<p>Every year my girlfriend and I set some common goals, where we both will chip in, like a long trip. Flights, hotels, rental cars, restaurants, and every expense during the trip comes from this account. This way we don't need to worry or feel guilty.</p>

<p>In the same fashion than with the previous savings accounts you can have as many joint savings accounts as you agree, for example start saving for a house downpayment.</p>

<h2 id="savings-account-investment" class="Title Title--cTypo1 Title--h2 Content-title Content-title--h2">7. Savings account</h2>
<h3 class="Title Title--h3 Content-title Content-title--h3 Title--cTypo3">Investment</h3>

<p>Savings account: <a href="https://www.vanguardinvestor.co.uk/investing-explained/stocks-shares-isa">Vanguard ISA</a></p>

<p>One of the take aways of learning about personal finance, and for some time now, I've been thinking more and more in the long term, and developing an interest in value investing. Once you are out of debt, and your basic needs and expenses are covered it should be time to think about how to invest the rest of the money and put the power of compounding to work for you.</p>

<p>There are several platforms where you can open an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/individual-savings-accounts" title="Individual Savings Account">ISA</a> account, and start investing in a balanced fund, diversified in equities and bonds. This should be as boring as it sounds, and with the lowest fees. Put in an amount you can afford every month and forget about it.</p>

<p>As with the other savings accounts, always take into account your <a href="https://www.gov.uk/individual-savings-accounts">ISA allowance</a> for the current tax year.</p>

<p>If after your contributions to the ISA you still have some money remaining you should consider re-balancing the other <a href="#savings-account">Savings account</a>, or put more money in a ISA taxable account.</p>

<p>In Spain I used <a href="https://indexacapital.com/es/t/K6dM4w">Indexa Capital</a>, which I keep open, but don't contribute to anymore.</p>

<h2 id="multi-currency-account" class="Title Title--cTypo1 Title--h2 Content-title Content-title--h2">8. Multi-currency account</h2>
<h3 class="Title Title--h3 Content-title Content-title--h3 Title--cTypo3">Travel, International transfers</h3>

<p>Multi-currency account: <a href="https://transferwise.com/i/carlosm39">TransferWise Borderless</a></p>

<p>There have been several occasions when I needed to transfer a considerable amount of money in a different currency. In those cases I used <strong>TransferWise</strong> despite you don't necessarily need a Borderless account. Nevertheless it can be convenient if you want to receive money in a foreign currency, with bank account details for <abbr title="Pound Sterling">GBP</abbr>, <abbr title="Euro">EUR</abbr>, <abbr title="US Dollar">USD</abbr>, and <abbr title="Australian Dollar">AUD</abbr>.</p>

<p>Also, I like to spend a couple of weeks abroad on holidays, and usually travel to Spain, and other countries for work. In those cases I pay in foreign currencies with <strong>Monzo</strong>.</p>

<div class="Content-aside">
  <p>While point of sale purchases in foreign currencies are free with <strong>Monzo</strong> at the Mastercard exchange rate (remember to pay in local currency) ATM withdrawals have a <a href="https://monzo.com/blog/2017/10/17/atm-limits-announcement/">£200 free allowance per month, 3% charge for foreign withdrawals thereafter</a>. Something similar applies to <strong>Revolut</strong> where, if you hold a currency, purchases at a point of sale are free but, if you hold other currencies, <a href="https://www.revolut.com/fee-schedule">their Exchange rate will be used</a>. <strong>TransferWise</strong> has a similar pricing model with <a href="https://transferwise.com/gb/borderless/pricing">better conversion fees</a>.</p>

  <p>So, the way to proceed when paying abroad is paying with my <strong>Monzo</strong> card whenever possible and, if I need to withdraw cash from an ATM use my £200 free allowance, and after that use my <strong>TransferWise</strong> Borderless card.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="donations-crypto" class="Title Title--cTypo1 Title--h2 Content-title Content-title--h2">Extra ball: donations, and innovative investment</h2>

<p>While not specifically saving money in a bank account, or spending it in some of the forms above, there are other means to make something useful with your money.</p>

<p>Every year I donate a part of my salary to some <abbr title="non-profit organization">NPO</abbr>, here are some of the ones that I find interesting:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.civio.es/dona/">Civio</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Home">Wikimedia Foundation</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.proactivaopenarms.org/en">Proactiva Open Arms</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://uk.movember.com/">Movember</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Also, there are other alternatives sucha as <a href="https://innovativefinanceisa.org.uk/">Innovative Finance ISA</a>, to receive tax-free interest on P2P lending platforms. Or apps like <a href="https://getchip.uk/">Chip</a> or <a href="https://blog.withplum.com/">Plum</a>, to start stashing money away automatically.</p>

<p>This system has worked for me but probably anyone can do OK with just a current account and a savings account. Depending on your short-term, medium-term, and long-term goals, <a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" class="Footnote js-Footnote">3</a> you will have different requirements. And when it comes to financial planning with a partner there are some key issues to take into account: <strong>communication, transparency, and shared values</strong>.</p>

<p>One of the best resources I found while doing research was the <a href="https://cs007.blog">CS 007: Personal Finance for Engineers</a> course at Stanford University, the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/">UKPersonalFinance</a> Reddit, as well as the <a href="https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/banking/compare-best-bank-accounts">MSE: Best Bank Accounts</a> comparison.</p>
