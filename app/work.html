<p>Since I joined CARTO I've worked in several roles, and helped grow the company from 15 to more than 100 employees. As <strong>Front-end engineer</strong>, I contribute to the product development of <a href="https://github.com/CartoDB/cartodb">CARTO</a>.</p>

<p>I've also managed and worked side by side with a team of talented designers, developers, and marketing, as <strong>Tech Lead</strong> of website.</p>

<p>I joined the <a href="http://www.vizzuality.com/">Vizzuality</a> crew in 2013, and it's been one hell of a ride, working on stories that matter. I built visualizations and web applications based on <a href="https://carto.com/">CARTO</a>.</p>

<p>I moved to Barcelona in early 2011 to start working as a <strong>UI developer</strong> in <a href="http://www.crisalix.com/en">Crisalix</a>, a web-based 3D simulator for plastic surgery and aesthetic procedures. This was my first real work experience.</p>

<p>Most notably working with <a href="http://jordivillar.com/">Jordi Villar</a>, <strong>we redesigned the interface, and rebuilt the platform from the ground up.</strong> As the company grew, I stablished a design process, managed the design team, and coordinated with the development team.</p>

<p>During this time <strong>we learned how important culture is in a fast growing company</strong>, as well as released several professional and consumer products, including an application for mobile devices.</p>
