<h2>2016</h2>
<h3>Endesa Datathon</h3>
<p><strong>Brief introduction to analysis and data visualization</strong><br />How to extract insights from data to make better decisions.</p>

<h2>2014</h2>
<h3>The Graphical Web</h3>
<p><strong>Telling stories with maps</strong><br />One of my first talks, and my first talk in English. I was scared as hell. I talked about how to create compelling stories through data visualisation, maps, narrative and multimedia elements.</p>
