<p>As I started training for triathlon in late 2015, I thought it could be interesting to add a section with the gear that I use.</p>

<h3>Swimming</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Arena swimsuit, goggles, and swim cap</strong><br />Basic equipment for swimming pool. I'm not doing any openwater yet.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Bike</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Scott Sportster X40</strong><br />Urban bike to ride in the city, and the occasional trail in Casa de Campo. I want to buy a road bike for the next season, I'm already considering a Scott Speedster 20 or a Canyon Endurace AL 6.0.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Gore Bike Wear Element Bib Tights</strong><br />Very confortable and warm bib tights, the quality makes the difference. — <a href="http://amzn.to/21TbdBo">Amazon</a></p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Gore Bike Wear Element Windstopper Soft Shell Jacket</strong><br />I love this soft shell jacket. It fits perfectly and protects from wind, and light rain. — <a href="http://amzn.to/1psWsaw">Amazon</a></p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Endura Xtract long sleeve</strong><br />I usually wear this under the jacket in cold weather. — <a href="http://www.chainreactioncycles.com/es/es/maillot-de-manga-larga-endura-xtract-ss16/rp-prod91321">Chain Reaction Cycles</a></p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Cold weather gloves</strong><br />5€ pair of gloves from Decathlon.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Running</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Running t-shirts</strong><br />Both long and short sleeve t-shirts from races, depending on the temperature, and time of the year.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Kalenji running tights</strong><br />I just have one pair but they wash and dry very quickly. I have had them for years.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Mountaineering</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Bestard Advance K Pro</strong><br />My first rigid boots, highly recommended. — <a href="http://www.barrabes.com/bestard-advance-k-pro/p-30922">Barrabes</a></p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>The North Face Summit Series jacket</strong><br />I use it almost every day, and in the mountains. It's quite waterproof, but if it starts raining/snowing I prefer to wear a ski jacket.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>The North Face Jester / Terra 65</strong><br />I like to carry a small backbpack for short trips. For longer excursions I use a big 65L backpack. — <a href="http://www.barrabes.com/the-north-face-terra-65/p-41978">Barrabes</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I've bought the previous products online from <strong>Amazon, Wiggle, Chain Reaction Cycles, Decathlon, and Barrabes</strong>, and I'm very happy so far with the products and the shipping.</p>
